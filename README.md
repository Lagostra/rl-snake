Snake

This project contains three files:
snake_env.py : playing the game Snake
agent_1.py : learning a Deep Reinforcement Learning Agent to play snake 
plot_script.py : plotting the results of the agent

You will need some Python packages, like turtle, TensorFlow and Keras before you can run the scripts.
